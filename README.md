# From Battlefields to MoMA Exhibitions: Cataloging 1929-2024 Exhibition History Unveiling War Stories

1. Introduction
How did MoMA illustrate WWI, WWII, and other wars through exhibitions?

This project leverages MoMA’s Open Exhibition Index Dataset to curate a catalog featuring twenty exhibition items  span-ning ninety five years of the institution’s history, all centered around the theme of "War". 

Today we are marked by per-sistent news of conflicts and warfare around the world. Del-ving into how contemporary art has grappled with these issues provides a unique avenue for reflection and a meaningful di-alogue about the way forward for us.
